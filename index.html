  <h1>The seasoned developer</h1>
  <img src="img/avatar.jpeg">
 <p>In the realm of code and circuits,
     I wander endless digital roads,
     Mapping dreams in tangled scripts,
     A journey where each error unfolds.
</p>
<p>
     Through the break of startup dawn
     And the dusk of corporate might,
     I wrestle with shifting bytes,
     Turning glitches into guiding light.
</p>
<p>
     Custom quests and varied calls,
     Each client’s hope a novel code,
     Amid the clamor of feedback’s rise
     And the silence when projects slow.
</p>
  <p>
     Every bug, a whispered lesson,
     Every crash, a chance to mend,
     In the ebb and flow of challenges,
     Resilience becomes my friend.
  </p>
<p>
     In late-night loops and early tests,
     Through triumphs and unforeseen fall,
     I find that wisdom grows in struggle—
     The seasoned developer, learning from it all.

    publish it throught a Cloudflare Tunnel. The poem has been created by Chat GPT. Probably this space will contain something different in the future.</i>
